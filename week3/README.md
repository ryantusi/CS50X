# CS50x: Week 3

Welcome to Week 3 of CS50x: C Algorithms

In this directory, you'll find problem sets (psets) and lab problems for Week 3. Delve deeper into programming concepts with the following exercises:

### Problem Sets
- **plurality**: Explore voting algorithms.
- **atoi**: Work on string manipulation and conversion to integers.
- **max**: Engage in problems related to finding maximum values.
- **snackbar**: Dive into simulations and problem-solving.
- **temps**: Practice handling temperature conversions and data processing.
- **runoff**: Implement a ranked-choice voting system.
- **sort**: Engage in sorting algorithms to organize data efficiently.

Feel free to explore each problem set's folder for comprehensive instructions and resources.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the `week3` directory.
3. Explore the problem sets and start solving!
4. Download the CS50 Library to run codes: [CS50 Library](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/releases)
