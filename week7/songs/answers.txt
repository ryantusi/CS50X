1.  To characterize the audio aura of a listener based on their top 100 songs from 2018.
    we can consider the average energy, valence, and danceability of these songs.
    Energy refers to the intensity and activity of the music, valence represents the positivity or happiness of the music, and danceability indicates how suitable the song is for dancing.

    To calculate the audio aura, we would take the average values of energy, valence, and danceability from the top 100 songs in the songs.db database for that specific listener.
    Let's consider the hypothetical results for this listener based on their 2018 top songs:
    Average Energy: Medium (The songs are moderately intense and active.)
    Average Valence: High (The songs are generally positive and happy.)
    Average Danceability: High (The songs are suitable for dancing.)

2.  The method of calculating the audio aura based on the average energy, valence, and danceability of a listener's top 100 songs might not be very representative due to several limitations:
    Limited Song Selection, Genre Variability, Temporal Changes, Lack of Context, Neglecting Lyrical Content.

    To create a more representative audio aura, Spotify could consider the following approaches:
    Fine-Grained Analysis, Genre-Specific Analysis, Incorporate Lyrical Analysis, Long-Term Analysis, User-Driven Customization.
    By employing these strategies, Spotify could create a more accurate and personalized audio aura, better capturing the listener's emotional nuances and musical preferences.
