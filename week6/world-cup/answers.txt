Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The more simulations the more it takes time

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
100,000 is good enough as it takes less than a second to execute but 1,000,000 takes almost 6 seconds which would cost me a few
